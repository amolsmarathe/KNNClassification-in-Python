# k-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm in Pure Python
### This is to demonstrate how KNN classification algorithm can be developed in pure python WITHOUT using Scikit learn library. It will help to understand the fundamentals of mathematics behind KNN Classification method of machine learning

## In covers following topics:
- Tests on dummy data
- Tests on real-world data
- Using pandas, matplotlib for
    - Data exploration
    - Data wrangling
    - Data visualization
    - Feature Engineering
- Split training and test data
- Finally, we calculate both "Accuracy" and "Confidence" for the predictions
- We end by checking the effect of reduction in test data size on "Confidence" of predictions
